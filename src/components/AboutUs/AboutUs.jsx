                Intelligence doesn’t seem like an aspect of personal character,
                and it isn’t. Coincidentally, great intelligence is only loosely
                connected to being a good programmer.
            </p>
            <p>What? You don’t have to be superintelligent?</p>
            <p>
                No, you don’t. Nobody is really smart enough to program
                computers. Fully understanding an average program requires an
                almost limitless capacity to absorb details and an equal
                capacity to comprehend them all at the same time. The way you
                focus your intelligence is more important than how much
                intelligence you have…

                …most of programming is an attempt to compensate for the
                strictly limited size of our skulls. The people who are the best
                programmers are the people who realize how small their brains
                are. They are humble. The people who are the worst at
                programming are the people who refuse to accept the fact that
                their brains aren’t equal to the task. Their egos keep them from
                being great programmers. The more you learn to compensate for
                your small brain, the better a programmer you’ll be.
